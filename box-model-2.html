        Just like regular individuals, companies use debt to make large purchases that they could not otherwise afford under normal circumstances. Corporations can usually borrow money by either taking out a loan at a bank or lending institution or by issuing fixed-income (debt) securities such as bonds and commercial paper.
        The best way to think about the debt load a company is carrying is in relation to its assets or equity. In absolute terms, a large company is likely to be carrying a large amount of debt. But relative to its assets or equity, the debt may be small.
        Different industries have different needs, too. Some companies are more capital-intensive, requiring large amounts of money to produce goods or services. In other words, that means the "right" amount of debt, or leverage, can vary from business to business.
