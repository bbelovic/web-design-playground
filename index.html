        <div style="text-align: left; text-indent: 1%;">This is division text with some <span style="font-weight: 100;">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><span style="font-weight: 700;">A</span>
            <span style="font-style: italic;"> adults and children in cultures where reading text progresses from left to right</span> also count objects from the left to the right side of space. 
            The reverse is found in cultures with a right-to-left reading direction. The <em>current</em> <i>set</i> of <strong>experiments</strong> investigated whether vertical counting in the horizontal plane 
            is also influenced by reading direction. Participants were either from a left-to-right reading culture (UK) or from a mixed (left-to-right and top-to-bottom) reading 
            culture (Hong Kong).</div>
            <div style="text-align: right;">In Experiment 1, native English-speaking children and adults and native Cantonese-speaking children and adults performed three object counting tasks. 
            Objects were presented flat on a table in a horizontal, vertical, and square display. Independent of culture, the horizontal array was mostly counted from left to right. 
            While the majority of English-speaking children counted the vertical display from bottom to top, the majority of the Cantonese-speaking children as well as both 
            Cantonese- and English-speaking adults counted the vertical display from top to bottom. This pattern was replicated in the counting pattern for squares: 
            all groups except the English-speaking children started counting with the top left coin.</div> 
            <div style="text-align: justify;">In Experiment 2, Cantonese-speaking adults counted a square array of 
            objects after they read a text presented to them either in left-to-right or in top-to-bottom reading direction. Most Cantonese-speaking adults started counting the 
            array by moving horizontally from left to right. However, significantly more Cantonese-speaking adults started counting with a top-to-bottom movement after reading the 
            text presented in a top-to-bottom reading direction than in a left-to-right reading direction. 
            Our results show clearly that vertical counting in the horizontal plane is influenced by longstanding as well as more recent experience of reading direction.</div>
