        <h1>Absolute positioning</h1>
        <div>
            The grocery business is highly competitive, with Kroger competing against the likes of Wal-Mart and Target, 
            as well as mom and pop grocery stores, as well as the likes of Amazon. The company needs to continuously invest in stores, 
            drive efficient operations, new products and innovation ( such as online, and delivery/pick up). 
            Kroger does have the scale of operations to effectively compete, and also has attractive store locations. This allows it to 
            be able to do online purchase and pick up at 57% of its stores and home delivery for 91% of customers. Back in 2018, Kroger 
            invested in Ocado, which is its exclusive grocery delivery partner in the US. Ocado delivers groceries in Europe. Kroger has 
            also made investments in new warehouses, store optimization, expanding its own private label brands and digital, in an effort 
            to drive long-term sales growth. <span class="abs-position">Same store</span> sales growth and cost reductions are the drivers that will propel earnings per share 
            growth over time.
